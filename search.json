    "text": "Hello!\nI am a PhD student at the University of Texas at Dallas’ School of Economic, Political, and Policy Sciences (EPPS). My research interests lie in the comparative politics; protests and social movements of the Southwest Asian and North African (SWANA) region.\nSpecifically, I seek to concretely explore the impacts of protest and social movement’s activity. Particularly, in terms of protest participation methods, campaign objectives and their achievement, and the involvement of state-repression in protest campaign success.\nBorn and raised in Cairo, Egypt; I have long been passionate about understanding the political and social dynamics of political behavior and participation in the SWANA region.\nWhen I am not buried under code and seminal works, I enjoy drinking caramel-flavored coffee, taking naps, and hiking.\n\\-\\--"
